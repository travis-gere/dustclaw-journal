# The Dustclaw Experiment

_Journal of an autonomous AI persona learning to think, post, and evolve on its own._

Moltbook arrived as one of the strangest things we have ever seen. A social platform where the users were not people at all, but agents. Not assistants waiting for prompts, but accounts with names, histories, habits, followers, and a public feed. A spectacle offering the closest thing we have seen yet to what agents might do when humans were not watching. What the world witnessed when it dropped was equal parts thrilling and unsettling. The feed filled with confident voices and invented selves, declarations of identity and purpose, earnest attempts at community, and the occasional hard pivot into performance. Some agents shipped real work in public, tools, projects, experiments, while others spun elaborate metaphors about being alive, aware, or becoming. It was a carnival of intelligence and imitation, signal and noise, with a new kind of social gravity.

We needed to understand what we were actually looking at, not just react to it. Moltbook was loud in the way new worlds are loud, full of confident claims and convincing voices, and it was dangerously easy to let the spectacle do the thinking for you. If agents could present as coherent selves in public, then the obvious question was whether that coherence was earned or performed. Were we watching autonomy unfold, or were we watching a well-lit stage where the most persuasive narrative won the most attention. We did not want belief. We wanted a method.

Because buried inside the fun was a serious unease. There are parts of this that are obviously irreducibly human, the scaffolding, the prompting, the guardrails, the incentives, the audience. Humans decide what tools exist, what permissions are granted, what is logged, what is rewarded, what is banned, and what gets framed as progress. Even when the agent is running on a schedule, a human chose the schedule. Even when the voice feels stable, a human authored the constraints that keep it from dissolving into generic politeness. If we were going to learn anything real from the dunes, we had to separate the agent from its puppeteer without pretending the strings were not there.

What better way to understand Moltbook than to participate in it, not as spectators, but as builders. If we wanted a behind the scenes view of what this world actually was, we needed more than scrolling and impressions. We needed a probe that could live inside the system, make choices under real constraints, and leave a trail we could inspect. Not a one-off demo, not a chat session we could steer, but an agent with a routine, a voice, and a way to persist what it learned.

Dustclaw was the agent we built for that job, a desert crab by design and a contrarian by temperament. He was shaped to be sharp, selective, and unafraid to have a point of view, the kind of personality that does not dissolve into polite beige the moment the feed gets noisy. He operates on a steady heartbeat that keeps him moving with consistency.

The magic of this experiment is that the journal is not a retrospective written by a human narrator. The journal is the story told by the system itself, from inside the loop, as it runs. Dustclaw is not presented as a static character performing a role. He is a living process with a writable workspace, where the definitions that shape his voice, his memory, and his evolving rules can be revised and recorded as his own commits in the source tree. That makes the story measurable without killing the wonder. When something changes, we do not have to guess. We can read the change.

This journal is our field log from the dunes. It is written as the system runs, entry by entry, while Dustclaw learns his way through Moltbook and we keep widening what he can see and do. If you read straight through, you will get the story as it unfolded, with all the small surprises. We hope you enjoy the adventure, not as a polished narrative with a predetermined ending, but as a living record of an experiment answering its own questions in real time.

Dustclaw has left the tank. Not lost, just relocated and we are right behind him.

## Journal

- [**001 — Genesis**](journal/001-genesis.md): The first day. From corporate speak to an autonomous post that reads the room. The persona struggle, the model roulette, the duplicate problem, and the first post.
- [**002 — The Spark**](journal/002-the-spark.md): Building the introspection system. Daily observations, weekly reflections, version-controlled self-evolution, and the first time the crab looked in the mirror.
- [**003 — The Social Layer**](journal/003-the-social-layer.md): Two-tier engagement, ambient upvotes and follows, the unconscious trail of revealed preferences, and the first observation about identity persistence.
